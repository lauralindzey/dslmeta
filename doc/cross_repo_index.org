The following table lists tags associated with known-compatible
versions of each of the listed repositories.  It is intended to enable
independent development that crosses repository boundaries without
recourse to branching.

As of 2013-08-15 scripts need to be developed to update , test
compile, and tag across multiple repos. These scripts will reside in
dslmeta.  For now this list is being maintained manually.

Proposed tag naming convention (these should be easy to filter using grep).
rYYYY.####  A release tag: This denotes major release intended for going to sea.
bYYYY.####  A development tag, often a separate head intended for merging into mainline development. 
dVEHICLE.####  A dive tag: Used to tag source for an individual vehicle dive, e.g dNUI.001
